You (the Licensee) are granted a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to create addons, extensions, integrations, and derivative works based on the original mod (including code-based addons, compatibility patches, and minor asset edits), and to distribute those addons and derivatives, including as part of modpacks.

Prohibited: you may not republish the original mod’s unmodified files (or substantially identical copies) as standalone downloads on external websites, file-hosting services, or marketplaces, nor present the original mod as your own. You may release modified versions provided you do not present unmodified original files as your own work.

Attribution is optional (appreciated but not required). The Author retains all copyrights. For uses beyond creating addons/including in modpacks (e.g., standalone rehosting, claiming authorship, or selling verbatim originals), obtain written permission. No warranty provided.
